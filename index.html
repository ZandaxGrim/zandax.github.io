<p> Drift Away Endlessly
  One day I awoke and found myself with a refined way of thinking. Not better just more refined. My outlook on the world around me became dark and foggy. I often look back on this and think about how it has influenced me. I hate that I care for people to the nth degree but in return get stabbed in the back over and over again. Nothing can be a success with other humans only varying degrees of failure. I wish to find love in a world where it feels ever so apparent that it should and does exist for others. It does not exist for me and I feel is that I am isolated from others no matter how close I get to them. Maybe I can blame it on my misspent teenage years that absolutely changed myself and shifted me to be a person I wasn’t. These days I think I’m so unsure of who I truly am that I live life as if I have a ball and chain attached to my leg yet anchored to nothing in particular. It’s a world of different masks and a lack of that baseline that I once had in the past. I wake up feeling either depressed or happy almost as if I’m hellbent on self sabotage. Maybe what I search for in others is a sense of brokenness that is the same as mine, someone who could understand what I go through on a daily basis. Knowing that once I fall asleep the world and people around me will reset to there baselines while I’m on a cycle of constant self deception hoping one day I find who I truly am.    

Should my goal be to make others happy or to make myself happy. It’s a concept that has always confused me. Being brought up from childhood being told to listen and not speak, to hide your true self because that is where others can inflict the severest of wounds. Yet the solution they don’t give you is what to do when you’re so stuck in the cycle that you can’t return to your true self even in the quiet hours alone with your thoughts. Oscillating ever on through oblivion in hopes of returned to that place where you once were. If I were to describe it, it would be a place of the abyss where nothing matters yet at the same moment everything matters. 
Why the fuck do you talk to me if I make you uncomfortable it’s makes no fucking sense. I shit you not I really like you but that shit pisses me off why talk to me if I make you uncomfortable. I’m really about to vocalize it it’s starting to piss me the fuck off if you do it again I’m going to say something.

      Dude why can’t the world just stop 
      The machine never stops        
      And that’s what sucks about not dreaming the machine never stops turning 
      It’s an endless cycle on repeat until one day your body gives out on you 
      It’s a sad reality 
      The rich walk on the poor 
      You either become the thing you hated for all your life or perish among the rest
